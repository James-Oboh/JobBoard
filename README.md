Here's a detailed and professional `README.md` for your Flask-based web app **JobBoard** — a mini-Indeed style application for job postings and applications with resume uploads:

---

```markdown
# 📄 JobBoard

JobBoard is a lightweight Flask web application that allows users to **post jobs**, **browse listings**, and **apply with a resume or file upload** — similar to a simplified version of platforms like **Indeed**. It is designed to be easy to set up, user-friendly, and extendable for custom job board needs.

## 🌟 Features

- 📝 Post new job listings (title, description, location, salary, etc.)
- 🔍 Browse and search available jobs
- 📂 Apply to jobs by uploading a resume or file
- 💾 Store job listings and applications in a database
- 📬 Admin or employer can view submitted applications
- 📱 Responsive UI (basic or with Bootstrap/your preferred framework)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python + Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2 Templates, Bootstrap (optional)
- **Database**: SQLite (default), can be swapped with PostgreSQL or MySQL
- **File Handling**: Flask-Uploads or Flask-WTF for file input
- **Form Handling**: Flask-WTF + WTForms
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn + Nginx (optional), or use Heroku/Fly.io for simple deployment
